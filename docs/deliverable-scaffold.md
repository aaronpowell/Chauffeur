The Scaffold Deliverable is used to start setting up some Chauffeur Deliveries (to be used with the `delivery` deliverable). It will ask you a few questions on getting everything setup. Assuming you use all the defaults you'll end up with a Delivery file on disk that contains an `install` step, a `user change-password` step (that is parameterised) and an export of your instance to import with the `package` deliverable.
